# AI Agent-Based Multi-Asset System Trading Architecture

## 1\. Overview

This document outlines the architecture for a modular, scalable, and resilient multi-asset system trading platform. The system is designed as a **Multi-Agent System** operating on an **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**.

The core of the system is a central **Message Bus**, which facilitates asynchronous communication between independent, single-purpose agents. This design promotes **loose coupling**, allowing for individual agents to be developed, tested, deployed, and scaled independently without impacting the rest of the system.

### Core Architectural Principles

* **Separation of Concerns (SoC):** Each agent has a single, well-defined responsibility. For example, the `NewsAnalysisAgent` only analyzes news; it does not make trading decisions.
* **Event-Driven & Asynchronous Communication:** Agents do not call each other directly. Instead, they publish event messages to the message bus and subscribe to the events they are interested in. This prevents system blocking and creates a resilient system.
* **Modularity & Scalability:** New agents (e.g., a new analysis technique, a new data source) can be added to the system simply. Agents under heavy load can be scaled horizontally.

## 2\. System Components & Agent Roles

The system is composed of several layers of agents, each performing a specific function in the data processing and trade lifecycle.

### 2.1. Data Collection Layer

* **Responsibility:** To act as the sole gateway for all external raw data. This includes market data (prices, volume), news articles, and macroeconomic indicators.
* **Implementation:** A dedicated `DataCollector` agent fetches data from various sources (e.g., brokerage APIs, news APIs, web crawlers).
* **Output:** Publishes standardized raw data messages to the message bus.
    * **Example Topics:** `raw.market_data.price`, `raw.news.article`, `raw.macro.indicator`

### 2.2. Analysis Layer

* **Responsibility:** To consume raw data and transform it into meaningful insights or signals. Each agent in this layer specializes in one type of analysis.
* **Agents:**
    * `TechnicalAnalysisAgent`: Subscribes to `raw.market_data.price`. Calculates indicators like RSI, MACD. Publishes results to the `insight.technical` topic.
    * `NewsAnalysisAgent` & `SentimentAnalysisAgent`: Subscribes to `raw.news.article`. Performs NLP to extract keywords, sentiment scores, etc. Publishes results to the `insight.sentiment` topic.
    * `MacroEconomicAgent`: Subscribes to `raw.macro.indicator`. Analyzes economic data to determine the market regime. Publishes results to the `insight.macro` topic.

### 2.3. Strategy Layer

* **Responsibility:** The central brain of the system. It synthesizes insights from all analysis agents to make the final trading decision.
* **Agent:**
    * `StrategyAgent`: Subscribes to all `insight.*` topics. It combines technical, sentiment, and macro insights based on its core logic (e.g., rules, machine learning models) to decide whether to buy, sell, or hold.
* **Output:** When a decision is made, it publishes a **Proposed Order** message.
    * **Example Topic:** `order.proposed`

### 2.4. Risk & Portfolio Management Layer

* **Responsibility:** To act as a crucial gatekeeper and state manager. It validates proposed trades against risk rules and maintains the current state of the portfolio.
* **Agents:**
    * `PortfolioManagementAgent`: Subscribes to `order.executed`. It is the single source of truth for current positions, cash balance, and P\&L.
    * `RiskManagementAgent`: Subscribes to `order.proposed`. When it receives a proposed order, it queries the `PortfolioManagementAgent` for the current state and validates the order against pre-defined rules (e.g., max position size, capital allocation limits).
* **Output:** If the order passes validation, it is re-published as an **Approved Order**.
    * **Example Topic:** `order.approved`

### 2.5. Execution Layer

* **Responsibility:** To interact with external brokerage APIs. It is the only component authorized to send and manage live orders.
* **Agent:**
    * `ExecutionAgent`: Subscribes to `order.approved`. It translates the internal order format into the specific format required by the target brokerage API.
* **Implementation Detail:** This agent utilizes a Go `Trader` interface, which provides a standardized way to interact with different brokerage APIs. This allows the `ExecutionAgent` to place trades without needing to know the specific details of each broker.
* **Output:** Once it receives confirmation of a trade from the broker (e.g., fill), it publishes an **Executed Order** message.
    * **Example Topic:** `order.executed`

## 3\. The Message Bus: The Central Nervous System

The message bus (e.g., NATS, Kafka, RabbitMQ) is the backbone of the entire architecture, decoupling all agents.

#### Example Message Bus Topics:

| Topic Name          | Publisher(s)          | Subscriber(s)                     | Purpose                                        |
| :------------------ | :-------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `raw.market_data`   | `DataCollector`       | `TechnicalAnalysisAgent`          | Distribute raw price/volume data               |
| `raw.news.article`  | `DataCollector`       | `NewsAnalysisAgent`               | Distribute raw news articles                   |
| `insight.technical` | `TechnicalAnalysisAgent`| `StrategyAgent`                   | Distribute technical indicator values          |
| `insight.sentiment` | `NewsAnalysisAgent`   | `StrategyAgent`                   | Distribute news sentiment scores               |
| `order.proposed`    | `StrategyAgent`       | `RiskManagementAgent`             | Propose a trade for validation                 |
| `order.approved`    | `RiskManagementAgent` | `ExecutionAgent`                  | Send a validated trade for execution           |
| `order.executed`    | `ExecutionAgent`      | `PortfolioManagementAgent`        | Confirm a trade has been filled                |

-----

## 4\. End-to-End Workflow Example (Buy Signal)

1.  **Ingestion:** `DataCollector` fetches a new price for stock `XYZ` and publishes it to `raw.market_data`.
2.  **Analysis:** `TechnicalAnalysisAgent` receives the price, calculates that the RSI is now below 30, and publishes this insight to `insight.technical`.
3.  **Decision:** `StrategyAgent` sees the `RSI < 30` insight and, based on its rules, decides to buy. It publishes a proposed order (`BUY 100 XYZ @ Market`) to `order.proposed`.
4.  **Validation:** `RiskManagementAgent` receives the proposed order. It checks the portfolio and confirms there is enough cash and the position size is within limits. It then publishes the same order to `order.approved`.
5.  **Execution:** `ExecutionAgent` receives the approved order. It connects to the brokerage via the `Trader` interface and places the buy order. The broker confirms the order is filled.
6.  **Confirmation:** `ExecutionAgent` publishes the fill confirmation (`BOUGHT 100 XYZ @ $50.10`) to `order.executed`.
7.  **State Update:** `PortfolioManagementAgent` receives the execution confirmation and updates its internal state: cash is reduced, and 100 shares of `XYZ` are added to the portfolio.

## 5\. The Role of the `backtest_agent`: A Special Case

The `backtest_agent` is a special component that allows for high-fidelity testing of the entire system.

* It works by reading historical data from a database and publishing it to the *exact same* message bus topics (`raw.market_data`, etc.) that the `DataCollector` would in a live environment, but at an accelerated speed.
* It also simulates an `ExecutionAgent` by subscribing to `order.approved` and generating realistic fills based on historical price action.
* **Benefit:** The `StrategyAgent`, `RiskManagementAgent`, and other core components can run on historical data **without any code changes**, ensuring that backtest performance is a highly accurate predictor of live performance.

## 6\. Polyglot Development: Choosing the Right Language for the Job üåê

A significant advantage of this architecture is the ability to develop each agent in the programming language best suited for its specific task. As long as an agent can connect to the Message Bus and handle a common data format (e.g., JSON), its internal implementation language is irrelevant to the rest of the system.

This **polyglot approach** allows us to leverage the strengths of different ecosystems for maximum efficiency and performance.

#### \#\#\# Language Recommendations per Agent Type

| Agent Category                                        | Primary Recommendation | Rationale & Key Libraries                                                                                                                                                             |
| :------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data-Intensive Analysis & Machine Learning**\<br\>*(Strategy, News/Sentiment/Technical Analysis)* | **Python** üêç         | The ecosystem for data science, numerical computation, and ML is unparalleled. It enables rapid development and access to state-of-the-art tools.\<br\>- `Pandas`, `NumPy` \<br\>- `TA-Lib`, `Pandas-TA`\<br\>- `Scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`\<br\>- `NLTK`, `Hugging Face Transformers` |
| **High-Performance I/O & Critical Infrastructure**\<br\>*(Data Collection, Order Execution, Risk/Portfolio Management)* | **Go (Golang)** üöÄ     | Ideal for high-performance network services that handle many concurrent connections. It's strongly typed, compiles to a single binary, and its goroutines are perfect for I/O.\<br\>- Excellent for implementing the `Trader` interface.\<br\>- Robust standard library for networking and JSON. |

#### \#\#\# How This Works

Interoperability between agents is guaranteed by two factors:

1.  **The Message Bus:** A language-agnostic broker (like NATS or Kafka) that simply routes binary messages.
2.  **A Standardized Message Format:** All agents agree to a common, language-neutral data format. **JSON** is a simple choice. For higher performance, **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)** are an excellent alternative.
